INTRODUCTION                                    *aspnetide-intro*

This plugin allows you to easily edit ASP.NET applications with vim. It attempts to give you some of the niceties you may be used to from a full IDE without getting in your way like a full IDE.

aspnetide defines the following commands:

|:ASPHelp|
|:ASPBuild|
|:ASPAltFile|
|:ASPRun|
|:ASPGoTo|

:ASPHelp                                         *:ASPHelp*
   Jump to online help based on selected word: F1 or <leader>ah

:ASPBuild                                       *:ASPBuild*
   Find a solution file for the project and build. Errors shown in quickfix. Function mapped to <leader>ab

:ASPAltFile                                     *:ASPAltFile*
   Navigate to alternate files (ASPX <-> code-behind). It will detect whether it's running in a webforms or MVC app. In webforms mode, it will jump between the view and code-behind files. In MVC mode it will jump between Controller and View template. Function mapped to <leader>af

:ASPRun                                         *:ASPRun*

:ASPGoTo                                        *:ASPGoTo*
